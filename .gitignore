## Below are example of common git excludes.
## Please note that /cookbooks folder is ignored. This allows users to
## clone individual cookbooks into the /cookbook folder of the chef repo
## and work on them in parallel. This pattern also allows for chef-workstation
## pattern, where base repo also builds out a dynamic chef workstation.
## Examples of workstation cookbooks:
##    https://github.com/mwrock/chef_workstation
##    https://github.com/Nordstrom/chefdk_bootstrap

## General
.gitignore.d/

## Ignore Chef related files and secrets

!.chef/knife.rb

## Ignore Chef-Zero files
