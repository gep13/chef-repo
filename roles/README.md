# Roles

Create roles here, in either the Role Ruby DSL (`.rb`) or JSON (`.json`) files. To install roles on the server, use knife.

For example, in this directory you will find an example role file called `example.json` which can be uploaded to the Chef Server:

```bash
knife role from file roles/example.json
```

For more information on roles, see the [documentation](https://docs.chef.io/roles.html)
